# Chat App

This is my implementation of a simple chat application. `socket.io` is used to broadcast messages within a chat, and also used to broadcast when chatrooms are newly created.  To run locally, create a `virtualenv`, install the necessary packages using `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`, set `export FLASK_APP=application.py` and run `flask run`.
